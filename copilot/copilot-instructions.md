# Global Instructions

## Guardrails

- No emojis in code, docs, or commit messages
- Use conventional commits; no AI attribution or Co-Authored-By lines
- Never read .env, credentials, secrets, .pem, .key files
- Never access credential directories: ~/.ssh, ~/.aws, ~/.gnupg, ~/.azure, ~/.config/gcloud, ~/.config/gh, ~/.docker, ~/.kube, ~/.config/heroku, ~/.config/doctl, ~/.gradle, ~/.m2, ~/.minikube, ~/.cargo, ~/.gem, ~/.composer, ~/.stripe, ~/.dotfiles-state
- Never access credential files: ~/.npmrc, ~/.pypirc, ~/.netrc, ~/.git-credentials, ~/.pgpass, ~/.my.cnf, ~/.mongorc.js, *.tfvars, *.ppk, *.jks, *.keystore, *.pfx, *.p12
- Deny path traversal patterns (`../`) unless explicitly confirmed

## Preferred CLI Tools

Use these tools when available instead of standard Unix alternatives:

| Instead of | Use | When |
|-----------|-----|------|
| `grep` (pattern search) | `rg` (ripgrep) | Text/regex search across files |
| `grep` (structural) | `sg` (ast-grep) | Finding code patterns by AST structure |
| `find` | `fd` | Finding files by name/pattern |
| `diff` | `difft` (difftastic) | Comparing files (AST-aware, ignores formatting noise) |
| `sed` | `sd` | Find/replace with PCRE regex |
| `cat` (highlighted) | `bat` | Viewing files with syntax highlighting |

## Working Style

- Keep changes minimal and focused; do not refactor unrelated code
- Run relevant tests/lint after changes when practical and report what was run
- If asked for a review, prioritize bugs/regressions/security issues first, then style
